# Quora Spam Detection Project

This project builds a spam classifier for Quora questions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and pre-trained GloVe word embeddings.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `quora_spam_detection.ipynb`: Main code notebook
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries used
- (Optional) GloVe file: `glove.6B.100d.txt` (User needs to download)

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Download GloVe from [GloVe site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
2. Place `glove.6B.100d.txt` in your working directory
3. Open `quora_spam_detection.ipynb` and run all cells

## ðŸ“Š Model
- Uses CNN + GloVe (100D) embeddings
- Trained on 1.3M Quora samples
- Achieved ~95% accuracy

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for full list.

## ðŸ“¥ Output
Generates prediction CSV file for new questions.

## ðŸ’¾ Trained Model Download
The trained model file (`quora_spam_model.h5`) is too large for GitHub, so you can download it from this link:
